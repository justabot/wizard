# Artcryption Blockchain Integration Specification

## Platform Overview

Artcryption is a creator-focused platform designed to encrypt and certify digital creations, providing verifiable ownership, copyright protection, and fraud prevention through blockchain technology. The platform enables creators to manage comprehensive metadata for their art, portfolios, storefronts, and catalogs while minting verifiable ownership certificates.

## Core Blockchain Architecture

### Smart Contract Foundation

**Primary Contract Structure:**
```solidity
contract ArtcryptionNFT is 
    ERC721URIStorage, 
    ERC721Royalty,

    ReentrancyGuard,
    EIP712
```

**Core OpenZeppelin Dependencies:**
- ERC721URIStorage: NFT standard with metadata URI storage

## Security Verification Methodology

### 1. Smart Contract Security

**Static Analysis:**
- Mythril security scanner integration
- Slither vulnerability detection
- Custom rule validation for business logic

**Dynamic Testing:**
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (>95%)
- Integration testing with mainnet forks
- Stress testing under network congestion

**Formal Verification:**
- Mathematical proof of contract correctness
- Property-based testing with Echidna
- Symbolic execution validation

### 2. Cryptographic Security

**Signature Verification Testing:**
```javascript
// Verification test structure
describe("Signature Security", () => {
  it("prevents replay attacks", async () => {
    // Test used nonce rejection
  });
  it("validates signer authorization", async () => {
    // Test unauthorized signer rejection
  });
  it("enforces signature expiration", async () => {
    // Test timestamp validation
  });
});
```

**Key Management Security:**
- Hardware Security Module integration
- Multi-party computation for sensitive operations
- Key rotation procedures and validation

### 3. Data Integrity Verification

**Content Hash Validation:**
- Real-time hash comparison against stored values
- Batch verification for gas efficiency
- Cross-platform hash consistency testing

**Metadata Security:**
- Schema validation against defined standards
- Encryption key management for private data
- Audit logging for all metadata changes

## Implementation Security Requirements

### Access Control Matrix

| Function | Requirement | Verification Method |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Minting | Valid signature + payment | EIP-712 verification + balance check |
| Metadata Update | Owner or authorized | Address verification + role checking |
| Royalty Setting | Owner only | onlyOwner modifier + bounds checking |
| Payment Withdrawal | PaymentSplitter logic | Automated distribution + balance validation |

### Gas Optimization Security

**Batch Operations:**
- Merkle proof verification for multiple items
- Optimized storage patterns
- Event-based data retrieval

**DoS Prevention:**
- Gas limit validation
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Rate limiting implementation
